```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Background
The goal of this assignment is to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

### Data
We will be looking at the `trees` data set, which provides measurements of the `Girth`, `Height` and `Volume` of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. Note that girth is the diameter of the tree (in inches) measured at 4 ft 6 in above the ground.

## Plot
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
g = ggplot(trees, aes(x=Girth, y=Height))
g = g + geom_point(aes(color=Volume)) + 
        ggtitle("Relationship between girth, height, and volume in trees")
ggplotly(g)
```
